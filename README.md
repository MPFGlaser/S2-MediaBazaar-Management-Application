# S2-MediaBazaar-Management-Application
## Purpose
This was a collaborative project with 3 other students in semester 2 of software engineering at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.
The goal was to make an application in which employees of a (fictional) company could perform actions relevant to the tasks at hand in an electronics store. This includes employee- and stock management, as well as scheduling of employees into their shifts.
This would then interface with a website at which employees could view their schedules.
Due to this being a group project in the early semesters of this course, code quality may vary wildly between different contributors.
